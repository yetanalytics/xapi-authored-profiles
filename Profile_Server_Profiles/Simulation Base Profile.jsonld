        "en": "Simulations focus on recreating hardware components, systems, and/or other situations for the purpose of training individuals and teams on these components.  Simulations include, but are not limited to, web-based simulations, desktop simulations, full-scale simulators, part-task trainers, maintenance trainers, and production systems that support a simulation mode.  Simulation content spans several modalities and covers a wide range of topics.  As a result, it is difficult to create an xAPI Profile that completely covers the data tracking requirements for every use case.  Instead, this Profile describes the basic xAPI requirements for all simulation content and provides best practices for extending this Profile for more specific simulation data tracking requirements.
