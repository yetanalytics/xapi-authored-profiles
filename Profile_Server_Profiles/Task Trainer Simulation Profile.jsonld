        "en": "A Task Trainer (TT) Simulation provides the ability to train critical and key task steps in documented, well-defined procedures. This category of simulation allows students to focus on their technical skill development through the application of knowledge in a manner that mimics the performance of their job in the Fleet. It gives students the opportunity for repeated practice to achieve mastery of those skill sets. The TT Simulation Profile is an extension of the xAPI Simulation Base Profile. It takes into consideration the related best practices for extending that Profile to support TT Simulation content’s unique characteristics and data tracking requirements. TT Simulation content can cover a wide range of systems and equipment."
